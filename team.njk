        <h5>Valerian McAlister</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Valerian has always had a clear goal: disrupt the status-quo.
           Through several business ventures, he has acquired the experience needed to finally soar as as self-made businessman.
           Innovation is his baby, and it shows. Innovation's growth and vision come from the seed he so skillfully sowed.

        <h5>Philippa Suzuki</h5>
        <p class="card-text"> UX is paradoxically both the cherry on the cake and the backbone of our process.
          We could only fill this important role with a gem. A rough stone, creatively unbound by rules and processes.
          Philippa is a free spirit, an anarchist and a methodist. She feeds on these contradictions and uses them masterfully in her craft.

        <h5>Jericho Von Vinhem</h5>
        <p class="card-text"> Jericho is the latest addition to Innovation's star-studded roaster. He craves knowledge.
          After an MBA in philosophy, Jericho started teaching in the rough slums of Bogotta. After 3 years of charity work, he went back to school
          to study computer science. This is the kind of profile that thrives in Innovation's environment.
          A keen interest in data science made us certain he would fit right in.

        <h5>Michel-Jacques Dubuisson</h5>
        <p class="card-text"> How good is your product if nobody knows it? Thankfully, Innovation never had to answer that specific question.
          Through diligent work and careful planning, Michel-Jacques (MJ for his friends) has made our product not only renowned in the field, but also synonymous with durability and luxury.

          <h5>Joachim Viquerez</h5>
          <p class="card-text"> Joachim is the hero we don't deserve. His work is beyond reproach and his work ethic made him a real superstar in the already glamorous field of web development.
            Some say he only stops working when he's satisfied with a product, and let me tell you , that is a pretty hard line to cross for him!
