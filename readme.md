# Bootstrap Exercice - Innovation.io

[Lien Github Pages](https://sim-frpt.github.io/Bootstrap-Innovation.io/)
Here you will create individually a website using Bootstrap. The goal is to practise HTML and web design in a corporate environment, using Bootstrap as a tool to facilitate that goal.

The pitch
You want to create a website for your new, revolutionnary, startup: Innovation.io. You don't have anything to sell right now and no ideas about what you could do as a business but your clients do not need to know that information. You just need to create a killer website to explain that your company will change the world.

Requirements
The website must be using Bootstrap and use as much as possible the features coming from it. (Like panels, forms, buttons, images, etc...) Custom CSS should be limited as much as possible. Please take a look at the Bootstrap's documentation.
It should not use a default Bootstrap, you must use a template. If starting from becode-js-web-template you have to change the Bootstrap template it already contains (Litera) by another one. You are of course completely free to create a completely new template by yourself (it's really hard to do it well but if you want...) or to alter an existing one.
Your HTML files should never contain duplicated code. (If using becode-js-web-template you can solve this issue easily by using Nunjucks.)
Your website must look professionnal. That's the whole purpose of the exercise. Consider that you truelly succeed it if you can convince someone outside the class that your website is a real company website.
Your website must be fully responsive. You must test it using Chrome's devtools to emulate a phone then by using your real phone.
Pages & Components
Navbar & common design
Your website must contain a navigation bar as well as a footer, both containing links to each pages of the website. They must remain unchanged on all pages.

Front page
The front page should contain:

A full-page-width carousel showing multiple images illustrating the values of your company with inspiring messages (use stock photos that look like enterprise, at least 3 photos)
A quote of one of your clients explaining how happy he is to work with you. You should also display his face. (Take and use a photo of someone else in the classroom.)
Something else. Be imaginative but not too much. Take a look at what other startups put on their front page as an inspiration and do the same.
Team page
Here you should display a list of all the persons in the company. No serious startup has less than 5 persons involved. (We don't say they work, but they are listed on the team page.)

Use the card component of Bootstrap to display your team.
Write at least the name and the role of the person.
Use photos of other persons in the classroom for your team page.
Contact page
In the contact page you must display a contact form for your future clients to contact you. (It doesn't have to be functional but it must look like it is.)

Insert also practical informations about your company : address, business hours and a google map.

Additionnal Requirements
It must look professionnal.
It must be fully responsive.
Yeah, we already said that. It's just to be sure you really understand.

Have fun and conquer the world
